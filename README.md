## About

Snudget is a competition app where you and your friends can challenge each other. Compete on who exercises the most, saves the most money, or whatever your imagination comes up with. Simply create a game and start tracking!

Can’t limit yourself to one competition? Why not create another? With Snudget, you can participate in multiple competitions at the same time. Compete with different people, across different goals, all at once.

With a clean design made for both mobile and desktop, Snudget keeps you connected and motivated—anytime, anywhere. Track your progress on the go and stay ahead of the game.

## Technical

I have built Snudget using modern technologies that are relevant today. The frontend is developed with Next.js and styled using Tailwind CSS. With Tailwind, I achieve a responsive web experience across both desktop and mobile devices.

I have built the backend in Node.js with Express for route handling and API logic. PostgreSQL powers the database layer, ensuring the consistent use of modern technologies and structured data storage for user accounts, competitions, and more.

Authentication is handled securely via email verification and hashed passwords or Google sign-in, giving users flexible sign-up options.

## TODO

-   Confirm game deletion
-   Example .env files
-   Implement leave game functionality
